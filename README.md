# PropagAtE-tutorial
  This is a tutorial for using PropagAtE (Prophage Activity Estimator) 
  # How does PropagAtE work?
  PropagAtE uses coordinates of prophages found using the bacteriophage detection software VIBRANT or from a coordinate file generated by the user and short sequencing reads to determine if each prophage is in the lytic (active) or lysogenic (dormant) cycle. PropagAtE determines the phage:host read coverage ratio, which will show if the prophage is actively replicating its genome (there are significantly more phage genomes present than host genomes) or if the prophage is dormant (it is about 1:1).
