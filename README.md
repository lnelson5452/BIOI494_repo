# PropagAtE-tutorial
  This is a tutorial for using PropagAtE (Prophage Activity Estimator) 
  # How does PropagAtE work?
  PropagAtE uses coordinates of prophages found using the bacteriophage detection software VIBRANT (other phage detection tools can be used you just have to alter the file)
  and short sequencing reads (I will show in the tutorial that long reads can be used as well). The phage:host read coverage will show if the prophage is actively replicating 
  its genome (there are significantly more phage genomes present than host genomes) or if the prophage is dormant.
